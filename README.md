## Motivation
*Team work for computer vision*

Trompe-l'œil (French for “deceive the eye”), originates with the artist Louis-Léopold Boilly. In ancient painting this meant creating the illusion of the third dimension on a two-dimensional surface with shading and perspective. We can just use a painting to depict the 3d world so why can’t we create an algorithm to reconstruct a 3D scene models from a lone image?   
Now we will introduce you to our ideas in this poster and let us go into the Picture!
